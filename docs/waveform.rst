Waveform Misfit
===============

.. warning::

    Please refer to the original paper [Tromp2005]_ for rigorous mathematical
    derivations of this misfit function. This documentation page only serves to
    summarize their results for the purpose of explaining the underlying code.

This is the simplest of all misfits and is defined as the squared difference
between observed and synthetic data.

The misfit :math:`\chi(\mathbf{m})` for a given Earth model :math:`\mathbf{m}`
and a single receiver and component is given by

.. math::

    \chi (\mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^T \left| \mathbf{d}(t) -
    \mathbf{s}(t, \mathbf{m}) \right| ^ 2 dt

:math:`\mathbf{d}(t)` is the observed data and
:math:`\mathbf{s}(t, \mathbf{m})` the synthetic data.

The adjoint source for the same receiver and component is given by

.. math::

    f^{\dagger}(t) = - \left[ \mathbf{d}(T - t) -
    \mathbf{s}(T - t, \mathbf{m}) \right]

.. note::

    For the sake of simplicity we omit the spatial Kronecker delta and define
    the adjoint source as acting solely at the receiver's location. For more
    details, please see [Tromp2005]_ and [Bozdag2011]_.

.. note::

    This particular implementation uses
    `Simpson's rule <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_rule>`_
    to evaluate the definite integral.

Usage
`````

The following code snippet illustrates the basic usage of the waveform
misfit function.

.. code:: python

    import pyadjoint

    obs, syn = pyadjoint.get_example_data()
    obs = obs.select(component="Z")[0]
    syn = syn.select(component="Z")[0]

    config = pyadjoint.get_config(adjsrc_type="waveform_misfit", min_period=20.,
                                  max_period=100., taper_percentage=0.3,
                                  taper_type="cos")

    adj_src = pyadjoint.calculate_adjoint_source(config=config, choice="waveform",
                                                 observed=obs, synthetic=syn,
                                                 windows=[(800., 900.)]
                                                 )
